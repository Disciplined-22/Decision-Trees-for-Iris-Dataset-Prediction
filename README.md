# ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Insights ðŸŒ³

Ever wondered how a computer decides which category a flower belongs to? Picture a Decision Tree as a smart guide making decisions for us! In our project, we dissect the decision-making process into individual trees. Each tree carefully examines features of the Iris dataset, like petal length and width, and offers its own guidance.

When you provide input (like the characteristics of an Iris flower), the Decision Tree navigates through its branches, following conditions on these features, until it reaches a final prediction. It's like a flowchart of decisions tailored to classify Iris flowers accurately.

## Conclusion

The accuracy of this Decision Tree model is an impressive 96% on the Iris dataset! ðŸŒ¿ðŸŽ‰. For more information and to check out the code click on [Decision Tree.ipynb file.](https://github.com/Disciplined-22/Decision_Trees-for-Iris-Dataset-Prediction/blob/main/Decision_Trees.ipynb)
